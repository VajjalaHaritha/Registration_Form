**Registration Form with MongoDB Backend**
This project is a simple web-based registration form that allows users to input basic details 
(such as name, email, and password) and stores the data in a MongoDB database. 
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is powered by Node.js/Express and MongoDB.
